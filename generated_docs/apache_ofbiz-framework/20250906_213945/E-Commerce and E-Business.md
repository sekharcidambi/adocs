## E-Commerce and E-Business

## Overview

The E-Commerce and E-Business capabilities in Apache OFBiz represent one of the framework's core strengths, providing a comprehensive suite of applications and services for building enterprise-grade online commerce platforms. OFBiz's e-commerce functionality is built on top of its robust entity engine and service framework, offering a complete solution that spans from catalog management to order fulfillment and customer relationship management.

## Core E-Commerce Applications

### E-Commerce Store Application (`/applications/ecommerce/`)

The primary e-commerce storefront application provides a fully functional web store implementation with the following key components:

- **Product Catalog Display**: Dynamic catalog browsing with category hierarchies, product search, and filtering capabilities
- **Shopping Cart Management**: Session-based cart functionality with support for multiple currencies and promotional pricing
- **Customer Account Management**: Registration, authentication, profile management, and order history
- **Checkout Process**: Multi-step checkout with payment processing, shipping calculations, and tax computation
- **Content Management**: CMS integration for managing store content, banners, and promotional materials

```xml
<!-- Example product category configuration -->
<ProductCategory productCategoryId="CATALOG1_ELECTRONICS" 
                 categoryName="Electronics" 
                 description="Electronic Products"
                 longDescription="Complete range of electronic products"/>
```

### Order Management System

The order management capabilities integrate seamlessly with inventory, accounting, and fulfillment systems:

- **Order Processing Pipeline**: Configurable workflow for order approval, allocation, and fulfillment
- **Inventory Integration**: Real-time inventory checking and allocation during order placement
- **Multi-facility Support**: Support for multiple warehouses and drop-shipping scenarios
- **Return Management**: Complete RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) processing

```java
// Example service call for order processing
Map<String, Object> orderContext = UtilMisc.toMap(
    "orderId", orderId,
    "statusId", "ORDER_APPROVED",
    "userLogin", userLogin
);
dispatcher.runSync("changeOrderStatus", orderContext);
```

```xml
<!-- Example price rule configuration -->

    <ProductPriceCond inputParamEnumId="PRIP_QUANTITY" 
                      operatorEnumId="PRC_GTE" 
                      condValue="10"/>
