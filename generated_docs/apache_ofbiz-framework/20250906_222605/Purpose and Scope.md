# Purpose and Scope

## Overview

Apache OFBiz (Open For Business) is a comprehensive enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) framework built on Java technologies. This documentation section defines the fundamental purpose, intended use cases, and operational boundaries of the OFBiz framework to guide developers, system integrators, and business stakeholders in understanding its capabilities and limitations.

## Primary Purpose

### Enterprise Application Framework

OFBiz serves as a robust foundation for building enterprise-grade business applications with the following core objectives:

- **Unified Business Platform**: Provide a single, integrated platform for managing diverse business operations including e-commerce, accounting, manufacturing, human resources, and customer relationship management
- **Rapid Application Development**: Enable developers to build complex business applications quickly using pre-built components and established patterns
- **Standards Compliance**: Implement industry-standard protocols and practices for enterprise software development

### Key Design Principles

```java
// Example: OFBiz Entity Engine demonstrates the framework's data abstraction principle
GenericValue product = EntityQuery.use(delegator)
    .from("Product")
    .where("productId", productId)
    .queryOne();

// Framework handles database abstraction across multiple vendors
```

The framework is built on several foundational principles:

1. **Data Model Driven**: Business logic and user interfaces are generated from comprehensive data models
2. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Business operations are implemented as discrete, reusable services
3. **Multi-tenant Capable**: Support for multiple organizations within a single deployment
4. **Internationalization Ready**: Built-in support for multiple languages, currencies, and regional business practices

## Functional Scope

### Core Business Domains

#### E-commerce and Web Framework
- **Online Store Management**: Complete e-commerce solution with catalog management, shopping cart, and order processing
- **Content Management**: Dynamic content creation and management system
- **Web Application Framework**: MVC-based web framework for building custom business applications

```xml
<!-- Example: Screen widget definition demonstrating OFBiz's declarative UI approach -->
<screen name="ProductDetail">
    <section>
        <actions>
            <entity-one entity-name="Product" value-field="product"/>
        </actions>
        <widgets>
            <decorator-screen name="CommonProductDecorator">
                <decorator-section name="body">
                    <include-form name="ProductForm" location="component://product/widget/catalog/ProductForms.xml"/>
                </decorator-section>
            </decorator-screen>
        </widgets>
    </section>
</screen>
```

#### Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)

### Technical Architecture Scope

#### Data Layer
```groovy
// Example: Groovy service implementation showing OFBiz service pattern
import org.apache.ofbiz.service.ServiceUtil

def createProduct = { context ->
    def delegator = context.delegator
    def dispatcher = context.dispatcher
    
    // Validate input parameters
    if (!context.productId) {
        return ServiceUtil.returnError("Product ID is required")
    }
    
    // Create product entity
    def product = delegator.makeValue("Product", context)
    product.create()
    
    return ServiceUtil.returnSuccess("Product created successfully")
}
```
