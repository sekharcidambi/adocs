# Contributing and Development

Welcome to the React development community! This comprehensive guide will help you set up your development environment, understand our contribution process, and participate in the React ecosystem. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, your contributions help make React better for millions of developers worldwide.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Before contributing to React, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18.0.0 or higher)
- **Yarn** (version 1.22.0 or higher) - React uses Yarn for package management
- **Git** (version 2.25.0 or higher)
- A modern code editor (VS Code recommended with React extensions)

### Initial Repository Setup

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub first, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/react.git
cd react

# Add the upstream remote to sync with the main repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/facebook/react.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
# Install all project dependencies
yarn install

# This may take several minutes as React has many development dependencies
```

3. **Verify Installation**

```bash
# Run the test suite to ensure everything is working
yarn test --maxWorkers=4

# Build React to verify the build process
yarn build
```

### Development Environment Configuration

#### Editor Setup

For optimal development experience, configure your editor with the following settings:

**VS Code Configuration (.vscode/settings.json):**

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  },
  "javascript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier": "relative",
  "typescript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier": "relative",
  "eslint.workingDirectories": ["packages/*"]
}
```

**Recommended VS Code Extensions:**
- ESLint
- Prettier - Code formatter
- TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features
- GitLens
- Bracket Pair Colorizer

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory for local development:

```bash
# Enable additional debugging features
REACT_APP_DEV_MODE=true

# Configure build optimization
NODE_ENV=development

# Enable source maps for better debugging
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=true
```

### Project Structure Understanding

React's monorepo structure is organized as follows:

```
react/
├── packages/
│   ├── react/                 # Core React package
│   ├── react-dom/            # DOM-specific React code
│   ├── react-reconciler/     # React's reconciliation algorithm
│   ├── scheduler/            # Task scheduling utilities
│   └── shared/               # Shared utilities and constants
├── fixtures/                 # Test applications and examples
├── scripts/                  # Build and development scripts
└── packages/react-devtools/  # React Developer Tools
```

### Building and Testing

#### Development Builds

```bash
# Build all packages for development
yarn build

# Build specific packages
yarn build react,react-dom

# Watch mode for continuous development
yarn build --watch
```

#### Running Tests

React uses Jest for testing with several test categories:

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests for specific packages
yarn test packages/react

# Run tests in watch mode
yarn test --watch

# Run tests with coverage
yarn test --coverage

# Run only unit tests (fastest)
yarn test --testPathPattern=__tests__

# Run integration tests
yarn test --testPathPattern=fixtures
```

#### Linting and Code Quality

```bash
# Run ESLint on all files
yarn lint

# Fix automatically fixable linting issues
yarn lint --fix

# Run Flow type checking
yarn flow

# Run Prettier formatting
yarn prettier --write .
```

### Local Testing with Fixtures

React provides several fixture applications for testing changes:

```bash
# Start the development server for fixtures
cd fixtures/packaging
yarn start

# Test with different React builds
yarn start --react-version=experimental
```

#### Feature Requests

Before proposing new features:

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Search for similar requests
2. **Consider Scope**: Ensure the feature aligns with React's philosophy
3. **Provide Use Cases**: Explain real-world scenarios where this would help
4. **Consider Alternatives**: Discuss why existing solutions are insufficient

#### Pull Requests

All code contributions should follow this process:

### Development Workflow

#### 1. Planning Your Contribution

```bash
# Sync with upstream before starting
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

#### 2. Making Changes

**Code Style Guidelines:**

- Use TypeScript for new code where applicable
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Write comprehensive tests for new functionality
- Update documentation for public API changes

**Example Component Implementation:**

```javascript
// packages/react/src/ReactNewFeature.js
import {useCallback, useMemo} from 'react';

/**
 * Custom hook for managing complex state logic
 * @param {Object} initialState - Initial state configuration
 * @param {Function} reducer - State reducer function
 * @returns {Array} [state, dispatch] tuple
 */
export function useComplexState(initialState, reducer) {
  const memoizedInitialState = useMemo(() => {
    return typeof initialState === 'function' 
      ? initialState() 
      : initialState;
  }, []);

  const dispatch = useCallback((action) => {
    // Implementation details
  }, []);

  return [state, dispatch];
}
```

**Testing Requirements:**

```javascript
// packages/react/src/__tests__/ReactNewFeature-test.js
describe('useComplexState', () => {
  it('should initialize with provided state', () => {
    const TestComponent = () => {
      const [state] = useComplexState({count: 0});
      return <div>{state.count}</div>;
    };

    const container = document.createElement('div');
    ReactDOM.render(<TestComponent />, container);
    expect(container.textContent).toBe('0');
  });

  it('should handle state updates correctly', () => {
    // Additional test cases
  });
});
```

#### 3. Commit Guidelines

Follow conventional commit format:

```bash
# Feature commits
git commit -m "feat(react-dom): add new hydration optimization"

# Bug fix commits
git commit -m "fix(scheduler): resolve memory leak in task queue"

# Documentation commits
git commit -m "docs(contributing): update development setup guide"

# Test commits
git commit -m "test(react): add coverage for concurrent features"
```

## Release Process

### Release Channels

React maintains several release channels to balance stability and innovation:

#### Stable Channel

- **Purpose**: Production-ready releases
- **Frequency**: Every 2-4 months for major versions, as needed for patches
- **Installation**: `npm install react@latest`
- **Versioning**: Follows semantic versioning (e.g., 18.2.0)

#### Release Candidate (RC) Channel

- **Purpose**: Pre-release testing of stable features
- **Frequency**: 2-4 weeks before stable release
- **Installation**: `npm install react@rc`
- **Usage**: Recommended for testing before stable release

#### Experimental Channel

- **Purpose**: Cutting-edge features under development
- **Frequency**: Continuous releases from main branch
- **Installation**: `npm install react@experimental`
- **Warning**: Not suitable for production use

### Version Management

React uses a sophisticated versioning strategy:

```bash
# Version format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
18.2.0
│  │  └── Patch: Bug fixes, no new features
│  └───── Minor: New features, backward compatible
└──────── Major: Breaking changes, new architecture
```

### Release Preparation

#### 1. Feature Freeze

Before each release:

- **Code Freeze**: No new features accepted
- **Stabilization**: Focus on bug fixes and performance
- **Testing**: Extensive testing across different environments

#### 2. Release Candidate Process

```bash
# Create release candidate
yarn build --type=RC
yarn test --env=production

# Publish to RC channel
npm publish --tag=rc
```

#### 3. Community Testing

- **Beta Testing**: Community tests RC versions
- **Feedback Collection**: Issues reported and addressed
- **Documentation**: Final documentation updates

### Automated Release Pipeline

React uses GitHub Actions for automated releases:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'yarn'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: yarn test --maxWorkers=4
      
      - name: Build packages
        run: yarn build --type=stable
      
      - name: Publish to npm
        run: yarn publish --access=public
