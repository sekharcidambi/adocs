# Key Features

## Core Medical Record Management

OpenMRS Core provides a comprehensive foundation for managing electronic medical records with a focus on flexibility and extensibility. The platform implements a robust data model that supports complex medical workflows while maintaining data integrity and security.

### Patient-Centric Data Architecture

The core framework centers around a **Patient** entity that serves as the primary aggregation point for all medical information. This architecture supports:

```java
// Example of patient data retrieval
Patient patient = Context.getPatientService().getPatient(patientId);
List<Encounter> encounters = Context.getEncounterService().getEncountersByPatient(patient);
```

- **Person Demographics**: Extensible person attributes supporting multiple identifiers, addresses, and demographic data
- **Patient Identifiers**: Flexible identifier system supporting multiple ID types (medical record numbers, national IDs, etc.)
- **Relationship Management**: Complex patient-to-patient and patient-to-provider relationship modeling

### Flexible Observation Framework

The **Obs (Observation)** model represents the cornerstone of clinical data capture, implementing a generic key-value structure that can accommodate any type of medical observation:

```java
// Creating a clinical observation
Obs weightObs = new Obs();
weightObs.setPerson(patient);
weightObs.setConcept(conceptService.getConceptByName("Weight"));
weightObs.setValueNumeric(70.5);
weightObs.setObsDatetime(new Date());
```

Key capabilities include:

- **Concept-Based Data Model**: All observations are linked to standardized medical concepts
- **Multiple Data Types**: Support for numeric, coded, text, datetime, and complex data types
- **Hierarchical Grouping**: Ability to group related observations (e.g., vital signs, lab panels)
- **Temporal Tracking**: Complete audit trail with creation, modification, and voiding timestamps

### Encounter-Based Workflow Engine

The **Encounter** framework models patient interactions with the healthcare system, providing structure for clinical workflows:

```java
// Programmatic encounter creation
Encounter encounter = new Encounter();
encounter.setPatient(patient);
encounter.setEncounterType(encounterTypeService.getEncounterType("Initial Visit"));
encounter.setLocation(locationService.getLocation("Outpatient Clinic"));
encounter.setProvider(Context.getAuthenticatedUser());
```

Features include:

- **Encounter Types**: Configurable encounter classifications (visits, procedures, consultations)
- **Provider Assignment**: Multi-provider support with role-based assignments
- **Location Tracking**: Hierarchical location management from facilities to specific rooms
- **Form Integration**: Seamless integration with HTML forms and structured data entry

### Comprehensive Concept Dictionary

The **Concept** system provides a standardized vocabulary for all clinical data, supporting international medical terminologies:

```java
// Concept lookup and usage
Concept diagnosisConcept = conceptService.getConceptByMapping("ICD-10", "E11.9");
ConceptName preferredName = diagnosisConcept.getPreferredName(locale);
```

- **Multi-Language Support**: Concept names and descriptions in multiple languages
- **Mapping Integration**: Built-in support for ICD-10, SNOMED CT, LOINC, and custom vocabularies
- **Hierarchical Relationships**: Concept sets and complex medical hierarchies
- **Datatype Enforcement**: Strict typing for numeric ranges, coded values, and complex data structures

### Advanced User Management and Security

OpenMRS Core implements a sophisticated role-based access control (RBAC) system:

```java
// Privilege-based security checks
if (Context.hasPrivilege("View Patients")) {
    // Execute privileged operation
    List<Patient> patients = patientService.getAllPatients();
}
```

Security features encompass:

- **Granular Privileges**: Fine-grained permissions for specific operations and data access
- **Role Hierarchies**: Inherited permissions through role-based assignments
- **Location-Based Security**: Geographic restrictions on data access
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all system interactions

### Extensible Module Architecture

The platform's **Module System** enables dynamic functionality extension without core modifications:

```xml
<!-- Module configuration example -->
<module configVersion="1.2">
    <id>reporting</id>
    <name>Reporting Module</name>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <require_modules>
        <require_module version="2.0.0">org.openmrs.module.serialization.xstream</require_module>
    </require_modules>
</module>
```

Module capabilities include:

- **Hot Deployment**: Runtime module installation and updates without system restart
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic resolution of module dependencies
- **API Extensions**: Ability to extend core services and add new functionality
- **Custom Web Resources**: Integration of additional web interfaces and REST endpoints

### Robust Data Management Services

The core provides enterprise-grade data management through Spring-based service layers:

```java
// Service layer interaction
@Autowired
private PatientService patientService;

@Transactional
public void updatePatientData(Patient patient, List<Obs> observations) {
    patientService.savePatient(patient);
    observations.forEach(obs -> obsService.saveObs(obs, null));
}
```

- **Transaction Management**: ACID-compliant database operations with rollback support
- **Caching Integration**: Hibernate second-level caching for performance optimization
- **Database Abstraction**: Support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other JDBC-compliant databases
- **Migration Framework**: Liquibase-based schema versioning and automated database updates

### Integration and Interoperability

OpenMRS Core facilitates healthcare system integration through multiple channels:

- **REST API**: Comprehensive RESTful web services for external system integration
- **HL7 Support**: Built-in HL7 message processing and generation capabilities
- **FHIR Compatibility**: Standards-based interoperability through FHIR module extensions
- **Custom Serialization**: Flexible data export and import mechanisms supporting various formats

This architecture ensures that OpenMRS Core serves as a robust foundation for healthcare information systems while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to diverse clinical environments and workflows.
