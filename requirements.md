1. Requirements Document
Project: Automated Documentation Structure Generator (ADocS)
1.1 Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for ADocS, a system designed to automatically generate an ideal documentation structure for a new GitHub repository. The system will leverage a knowledge base of ~200 existing repositories, using their metadata to infer a relevant and hierarchical documentation plan for a new input repository. The goal is to standardize and accelerate the documentation process, ensuring quality and consistency across all our projects.

1.2 Functional Requirements (FRs)
FR1: Data Ingestion: The system must be able to ingest the metadata of a new GitHub repository provided in the standard _analysis.json format.

FR2: Knowledge Base Processing: The system must process and load the existing corpus of ~200 _analysis.json files and the corresponding "ideal" documentation structures from deepwiki_docs.json.

FR3: Similarity Analysis: The system must analyze the new repository's metadata (specifically overview, tech_stack, and architecture) and identify the top k (e.g., k=3) most similar repositories from the knowledge base.

FR4: Structure Generation: The system must use the metadata of the new repository and the documentation structures of the similar repositories to generate a new, ideal documentation structure in a valid JSON format.

FR5: Output: The system must output the generated JSON structure.

1.3 Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
NFR1: Relevance: The generated documentation structure must be highly relevant to the new repository's business domain, tech stack, and architecture.

NFR2: Maintainability: The system should be designed so that the knowledge base of repositories can be easily updated or expanded over time.

NFR3: Scalability: The core logic should be efficient enough to handle a knowledge base of thousands of repositories in the future.

NFR4: Performance: The system should generate a documentation structure in under 30 seconds to facilitate rapid use in our workflows.

1.4 Out of Scope
This system will not write the actual content (the markdown/text) for the documentation pages.

This system will not perform a real-time analysis of the new repository's source code. It relies solely on the provided metadata JSON.

This system will not include a graphical user interface (GUI). It will be a command-line tool or a library.
