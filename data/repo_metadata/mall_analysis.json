  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Monolith",
    "description": "The `mall` project follows a monolithic architecture pattern, where the entire application is built as a single, integrated system. The application is divided into several modules, including `mall-common`, `mall-mbg`, `mall-security`, `mall-admin`, `mall-search`, and `mall-portal`. These modules interact with each other to provide the overall functionality of the e-commerce system. The monolithic architecture was chosen for its simplicity, ease of development, and deployment, as well as the ability to share common code and resources across the different modules. The system is designed to be scalable, with the ability to scale individual modules or the entire application as needed. The monolithic approach also provides a unified user experience and simplifies the management and maintenance of the system. While a microservices-based architecture could offer more flexibility and scalability, the project's current requirements and development team size make the monolithic pattern a suitable choice."
