  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Component-based",
    "description": "The shadcn/ui project follows a component-based architecture, where the UI is divided into reusable, modular components. Each component is self-contained and encapsulates its own structure, styles, and behavior. This architectural pattern allows for better maintainability, scalability, and flexibility, as components can be easily composed, tested, and reused across different parts of the application. The project uses a monorepo structure, which helps manage the various components and their dependencies more effectively. The components are organized into different style categories, such as 'default' and 'new-york', allowing developers to choose the set of components that best fits their project's design. The project also utilizes modern front-end tools and technologies, such as Turborepo for build optimization and Changesets for managing releases, to ensure a smooth and efficient development process."
