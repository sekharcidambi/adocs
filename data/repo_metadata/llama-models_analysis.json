    "pattern": "Modular, Microservices",
    "description": "The Llama models architecture follows a modular, microservices-based design. The system is composed of several independent components, including the language model, tokenizer, and inference scripts, that can be deployed and scaled independently. This allows for flexibility in deployment, easier maintenance, and the ability to update individual components without affecting the entire system. The modular design also enables the integration of additional components, such as trust and safety tools, to enhance the overall functionality and responsible use of the Llama models. The microservices-based approach promotes scalability, as each component can be scaled up or down based on demand, and the system can be easily distributed across multiple servers or cloud environments. This architectural pattern was chosen to support the project's goals of open access, a broad ecosystem, and responsible AI development, allowing the Llama models to be easily integrated into a wide range of applications and environments."
