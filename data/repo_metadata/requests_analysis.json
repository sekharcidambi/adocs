  "overview": "Requests is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library for the Python programming language. It allows developers to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily, without the need to manually add query strings to URLs or form-encode data. Requests is one of the most widely used Python packages, with over 30 million downloads per week and over 1 million dependent repositories. It provides a wide range of features to build robust and reliable HTTP-speaking applications, including keep-alive and connection pooling, international domain and URL support, cookie persistence, SSL/TLS verification, authentication, and more. Requests is designed to make working with HTTP easy and intuitive, abstracting away the complexities of the underlying urllib3 library and providing a Pythonic, user-friendly API. It is a highly popular and trusted library that has become an essential tool in the Python developer's toolkit.",

    "pattern": "Layered Architecture",
    "description": "Requests follows a layered architectural pattern, with each layer providing a specific set of functionality and abstracting away the complexities of the lower layers. At the core is the urllib3 library, which handles the low-level HTTP protocol details. Requests then provides a higher-level, user-friendly API on top of urllib3, handling tasks such as session management, authentication, and response parsing. This layered approach allows Requests to provide a simple and intuitive interface for developers, while still leveraging the power and flexibility of the underlying HTTP library. The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, with the ability to swap out components (such as the transport adapter) as needed. This makes Requests highly adaptable and suitable for a wide range of HTTP-based applications, from simple scripts to complex, enterprise-level systems. The layered design also promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to extend over time."
