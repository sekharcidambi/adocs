    "description": "The project follows a monolithic architecture, where all the functionality is bundled into a single, comprehensive repository. This approach allows for a streamlined and centralized management of the various tools, scripts, and tutorials provided. The monolithic structure enables the project maintainers to easily update, maintain, and distribute the entire suite of resources as a cohesive unit. This architectural choice is suitable for the project's purpose, as it prioritizes simplicity, ease of use, and accessibility for the target audience, who may not have extensive technical expertise. The monolithic design ensures that users can access all the necessary information and resources from a single source, without the complexity of managing multiple, interconnected components. This architecture also facilitates the continuous improvement and expansion of the project's offerings, as new features and updates can be seamlessly integrated into the existing codebase."

    "install": "The project does not provide specific installation instructions, as it primarily consists of documentation, scripts, and links to external resources. Users are expected to follow the instructions and guidance provided in the project's wiki and documentation to set up the various circumvention tools and services.",
    "run": "The project does not provide a single command to run the application, as it is not a standalone software application. Users are expected to follow the instructions in the documentation to set up and configure the appropriate circumvention tools and services for their specific needs.",
    "test": "The project does not provide specific testing instructions, as it is primarily a collection of resources and documentation. Users are expected to test the functionality of the circumvention tools and services they set up based on the provided guidance."
