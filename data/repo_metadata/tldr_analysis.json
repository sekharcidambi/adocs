  "overview": "The tldr-pages project is a collection of community-maintained help pages for command-line tools, aimed at providing a simpler and more approachable complement to traditional man pages. The project was created to address the problem that many command-line tools have complex and verbose documentation, which can be difficult for new or occasional users to navigate. The tldr-pages repository contains a growing collection of examples for the most common UNIX, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, SunOS, Android, Windows, and Cisco IOS command-line tools. The pages are written in Markdown and focus on providing practical, easy-to-understand usage examples rather than comprehensive documentation. The project is designed to be a user-friendly resource for developers, system administrators, and anyone else who needs quick access to command-line tool information without having to wade through lengthy man pages.",

    "description": "The tldr-pages project follows a distributed, community-driven architecture. The project is hosted on GitHub, where contributors from around the world can submit new pages, update existing ones, and translate content into different languages. There is no central authority or maintainer team that controls the project; instead, the community operates on a do-ocracy principle, where anyone can get involved and their contributions are welcomed. The project uses a flat, non-hierarchical governance structure, with decisions made by community consensus rather than top-down decision-making. This allows the project to be highly scalable and adaptable, as new contributors can easily join and help expand the collection of command-line tool examples. The distributed nature of the project also makes it resilient, as no single point of failure can bring down the entire system. The community-driven approach ensures that the content remains relevant and up-to-date, as users can quickly submit updates or new pages to reflect changes in command-line tools over time."
