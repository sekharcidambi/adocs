  "overview": "Astro is a modern website building tool that provides a powerful developer experience while producing lightweight output. It is designed to help developers build fast, content-focused websites and web applications. Astro uses a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI components that can be rendered on the server or client-side. It supports a variety of popular front-end frameworks like React, Preact, Svelte, and Vue, making it flexible and adaptable to different project needs. Astro's key focus is on performance, with features like partial hydration and static site generation to ensure fast load times and a great user experience. By abstracting away the complexities of server-side rendering and client-side interactivity, Astro empowers developers to build high-performance web projects with ease.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Microservices",
    "description": "Astro follows a microservices architectural pattern, where the core functionality is divided into several independent, loosely coupled services. The main components of Astro's architecture include the CLI, the core build and development server, the runtime, and various integrations. The CLI is responsible for managing the development workflow, including commands to create new projects, start the development server, and build the final output. The core build and development server handles the server-side rendering, static site generation, and live reloading during development. The runtime is divided into client-side and server-side components, allowing for efficient server-side rendering and partial client-side hydration. The integrations, such as support for different front-end frameworks and deployment platforms, are implemented as separate modules that can be easily added or removed from a project. This modular, microservices-based approach allows Astro to be highly extensible and adaptable, making it suitable for a wide range of web development projects. The architectural decisions, such as the separation of concerns and the use of partial hydration, are driven by Astro's focus on performance and developer experience."
