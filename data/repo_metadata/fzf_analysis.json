  "overview": "fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder that can be used with any list-based application. It is designed to be fast and flexible, allowing users to quickly search and select items from large lists. The primary purpose of fzf is to provide an efficient and intuitive way for developers to navigate and interact with files, directories, and other data sources within their development workflows. fzf solves the problem of quickly finding and opening relevant files or directories from the command line, which is a common task for developers. It offers a powerful and customizable interface that integrates seamlessly with various shells and text editors, enhancing developer productivity and streamlining common development tasks.",

    "pattern": "Component-based",
    "description": "The architecture of fzf follows a component-based design, where the core functionality is implemented as a standalone command-line tool that can be integrated into various development environments and workflows. The fzf Vim plugin, which is the focus of the provided documentation, acts as a bridge between the fzf command-line tool and the Vim text editor. The plugin provides a set of functions and commands that allow Vim users to leverage the fuzzy finding capabilities of fzf directly within their Vim workflows. The plugin's architecture is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to customize the behavior and appearance of the fzf integration to suit their specific needs. The use of a component-based approach enables fzf to be easily integrated into a wide range of development tools and environments, making it a versatile and widely-adopted solution for developer productivity."

  "setup": {
    "install": "To install fzf in Vim, add the directory containing the fzf binary to the 'runtimepath' in your Vim configuration file. For example:\n\n```\n\" If installed using Homebrew\nset rtp+=/usr/local/opt/fzf\n\n\" If installed using Homebrew on Apple Silicon\nset rtp+=/opt/homebrew/opt/fzf\n\n\" If you have cloned fzf on ~/.fzf directory\nset rtp+=~/.fzf\n```",
    "run": "To start fzf in Vim, use the `:FZF` command. For example:\n\n```\n\" Look for files under current directory\n:FZF\n\n\" Look for files under your home directory\n:FZF ~\n\n\" With fzf command-line options\n:FZF --reverse --info=inline /tmp\n\n\" Bang version starts fzf in fullscreen mode\n:FZF!\n```",
    "test": "There are no specific test commands provided in the documentation. However, you can test the fzf integration by using the `:FZF` command and verifying that it works as expected."
