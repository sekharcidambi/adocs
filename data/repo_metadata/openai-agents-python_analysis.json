  "overview": "The OpenAI Agents SDK is a lightweight yet powerful framework for building multi-agent workflows. It allows developers to create intelligent agents that can be configured with instructions, tools, guardrails, and handoffs. The SDK supports the OpenAI Responses and Chat Completions APIs, as well as over 100 other large language models (LLMs). Key capabilities of the SDK include automatic conversation history management, built-in tracing for debugging and optimization, and the ability to run durable, long-running workflows with human-in-the-loop tasks. The Agents SDK is designed to be highly flexible, enabling developers to model a wide range of LLM workflows including deterministic flows, iterative loops, and more. It solves the problem of building complex, multi-agent systems by providing a unified framework and set of abstractions that make it easier to design, implement, and maintain these types of applications.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Microservices",
    "description": "The OpenAI Agents SDK follows a microservices architectural pattern. The core components of the system include RealtimeAgent, RealtimeRunner, RealtimeSession, and RealtimeModel. RealtimeAgent represents a configured LLM agent with instructions, tools, and handoffs. RealtimeRunner manages the execution of agent sessions, while RealtimeSession handles a single conversational session, maintaining the context and history. RealtimeModel is the interface to the underlying LLM provider, such as the OpenAI WebSocket API. This modular, microservices-based design allows the SDK to be highly extensible and adaptable to different LLM providers and use cases. The separation of concerns between these components enables developers to easily customize or replace individual parts of the system as needed. Additionally, the microservices architecture supports scalability, as the different components can be scaled independently based on demand. This pattern was chosen to provide a flexible, maintainable, and scalable foundation for building complex, multi-agent workflows on top of large language models."
