  "overview": "The ML-For-Beginners repository is a comprehensive 12-week, 26-lesson curriculum created by Microsoft Cloud Advocates to teach the fundamentals of classic machine learning. It covers a wide range of topics, including regression, classification, clustering, natural language processing, and time series forecasting. The curriculum is designed to be hands-on and project-based, allowing learners to apply the techniques they learn to real-world datasets from around the world. Each lesson includes pre- and post-lecture quizzes, step-by-step guides, challenges, and assignments to reinforce the concepts. The goal is to provide a flexible and engaging learning experience for beginners interested in machine learning, complementing Microsoft's AI for Beginners and Data Science for Beginners curricula. The project-based approach and frequent quizzes are designed to enhance retention and make the learning process more enjoyable and effective.",

    "description": "The ML-For-Beginners repository follows a monolithic architecture, where all the lessons, code, and supporting materials are contained within a single GitHub repository. This approach was chosen to provide a cohesive and self-contained learning experience for students. By having all the resources in one place, students can easily navigate through the curriculum, access the relevant files, and complete the exercises without having to manage multiple repositories or external dependencies. The monolithic structure also simplifies the setup and deployment process, as students can simply clone the repository and start working on the lessons. This architectural decision aligns with the project-based pedagogy, where the focus is on hands-on learning and building practical skills, rather than on complex system design. The simplicity of the monolithic approach allows learners to concentrate on the machine learning concepts without being distracted by the underlying infrastructure."
