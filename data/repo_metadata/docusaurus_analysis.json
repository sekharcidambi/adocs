  "overview": "Docusaurus is an open-source project for building, deploying, and maintaining websites for open-source projects. It is designed to be simple to set up and get running quickly, with features like localization support, customizability, and a built-in blog. Docusaurus aims to handle the website build process so project maintainers can focus on their content and code. It provides a set of key pages and sections out-of-the-box, including a home page, documentation section, and blog, while also allowing for extensive customization to ensure a unique site. Docusaurus is used by many open-source projects at Meta and is intended to help scale and support the documentation needs of these projects. The project is open to contributions from the community, with a focus on making it easy for new contributors to get involved through beginner-friendly issues and a welcoming community.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Component-based",
    "description": "Docusaurus follows a component-based architecture, where the application is built up from reusable UI components. This allows for a high degree of customizability, as site owners can compose pages from these components and style them to match their branding and design. The core Docusaurus framework provides a set of base components that handle common website functionality, such as the sidebar, navbar, and blog. Site owners can then extend or override these components as needed. The component-based approach also enables features like live reloading and hot module replacement during development, as individual components can be updated without a full page refresh. This architecture decision was made to prioritize flexibility and ease of customization, as Docusaurus is designed to support a wide variety of open-source projects with different needs and design requirements. The modular, composable nature of the components allows site owners to quickly build and iterate on their documentation websites."
