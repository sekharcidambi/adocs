  "overview": "Zod is a TypeScript-first schema validation library that allows developers to define schemas and parse data against those schemas. It provides a concise, immutable API for defining complex data structures and validating input data. Zod's key features include zero external dependencies, small bundle size, and the ability to infer static types from schema definitions. This enables developers to create strongly-typed, validated data structures that can be used with confidence throughout their applications. Zod is designed to solve the common problem of validating untrusted data, ensuring data integrity and type safety. Its extensive ecosystem and built-in JSON Schema conversion make it a powerful tool for a wide range of TypeScript and JavaScript projects.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Component-based",
    "description": "Zod's architecture follows a component-based design, where the library is composed of modular, reusable components that can be combined to create complex schemas. The core of Zod is a set of primitive data types (e.g., string, number, boolean) that can be composed using various combinators (e.g., object, array, union) to define custom data structures. This component-based approach allows for a highly flexible and extensible system, where developers can easily create new data types or extend existing ones to suit their specific needs. The immutable API ensures that schema definitions are treated as immutable values, promoting predictable behavior and reducing the risk of unintended side effects. The architecture also includes error handling mechanisms, such as the ZodError class, which provides detailed information about validation failures. This modular, component-based design aligns well with the TypeScript-first nature of Zod, enabling seamless type inference and static type checking throughout the codebase."
