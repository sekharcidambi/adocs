  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Modular",
    "description": "The yt-dlp project follows a modular architecture, where the core functionality is divided into reusable components and modules. This architectural pattern allows for better maintainability, extensibility, and flexibility. The main components include the download manager, extractor modules for different websites, post-processing utilities, and a command-line interface. The extractor modules are responsible for handling the specific requirements of each supported website, such as authentication, URL parsing, and content extraction. The download manager coordinates the overall download process, handling tasks like network requests, file handling, and progress tracking. The post-processing utilities provide features like format conversion, metadata manipulation, and file renaming. The modular design of yt-dlp enables easy integration of new features, support for additional websites, and customization to meet the diverse needs of its user base. This architectural approach also promotes scalability, as new modules can be added without affecting the core functionality, and the application can handle an increasing number of supported websites and use cases."
