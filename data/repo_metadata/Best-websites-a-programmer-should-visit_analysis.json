    "description": "The project follows a monolithic architectural pattern, as it is a single repository containing a curated list of websites organized into different sections. This approach is suitable for the project's purpose, as it allows for easy maintenance, updates, and contributions from the community. The repository is structured with a README.md file as the main entry point, which contains the list of websites organized by category. The project also includes supporting files, such as the CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, which provide guidelines and rules for contributors. This simple, straightforward architecture ensures that the project remains focused on its primary goal of aggregating and maintaining a comprehensive list of valuable websites for programmers, without the need for a more complex, distributed system."
