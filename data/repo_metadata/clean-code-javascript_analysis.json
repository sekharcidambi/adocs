  "overview": "This project, 'clean-code-javascript', is a guide to writing clean, maintainable, and scalable JavaScript code. It provides a comprehensive set of principles, best practices, and coding standards that developers can follow to improve the quality and readability of their JavaScript codebase. The guide covers a wide range of topics, including function naming, variable naming, file organization, error handling, and code formatting, among others. The primary goal of this project is to help JavaScript developers write code that is easy to understand, debug, and maintain, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective software development. By following the guidelines and recommendations outlined in this repository, developers can improve the overall quality and robustness of their JavaScript applications, making them more reliable and easier to scale over time.",

    "description": "This project does not have a specific software architecture, as it is a collection of guidelines and best practices for writing clean JavaScript code. It does not involve the design or implementation of a software system, but rather provides a set of principles and recommendations that can be applied to any JavaScript codebase, regardless of the underlying architectural pattern. The focus of this project is on improving the readability, maintainability, and scalability of JavaScript code through the adoption of well-established coding standards and practices. The guidelines cover a wide range of topics, from function and variable naming conventions to error handling and code formatting, all with the goal of making the codebase more understandable and easier to work with over time. By following these recommendations, developers can create JavaScript applications that are more modular, testable, and adaptable to changing requirements, without being tied to a specific architectural pattern."
