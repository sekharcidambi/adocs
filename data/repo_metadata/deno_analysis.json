  "overview": "Deno is a modern, secure, and developer-friendly JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. It is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine, Rust, and Tokio, providing a robust and efficient runtime environment for building a wide range of applications, from web servers to command-line tools. Deno aims to address the shortcomings of the traditional Node.js runtime by introducing features like built-in support for TypeScript, improved security through permission-based access control, and a focus on developer productivity and ease of use. With its modern design and emphasis on developer experience, Deno is well-suited for building scalable, reliable, and maintainable software projects, particularly in the context of modern web development and cloud-native applications.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Modular, Event-driven",
    "description": "Deno's architecture follows a modular, event-driven design. The core runtime is built using Rust, which provides a high-performance, low-level foundation. On top of this, Deno integrates the V8 JavaScript engine to execute JavaScript and TypeScript code, and the Tokio asynchronous runtime for efficient I/O operations. Deno's modular design allows for easy extensibility, with various components, such as the module loader, file system access, and network communication, implemented as separate modules that can be easily replaced or extended as needed. This modular approach, combined with Deno's event-driven architecture, enables a highly scalable and flexible runtime that can adapt to a wide range of use cases and deployment scenarios. The event-driven nature of Deno's design also promotes asynchronous, non-blocking I/O, which is crucial for building high-performance, responsive applications. Overall, Deno's architecture is well-suited for modern, cloud-native development, providing a secure, efficient, and developer-friendly runtime environment for building scalable, maintainable software systems."
