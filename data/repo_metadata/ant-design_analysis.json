  "overview": "Ant Design is an enterprise-class UI design language and React UI library. It provides a set of high-quality React components out of the box, written in TypeScript with predictable static types. Ant Design offers a whole package of design resources and development tools, including internationalization support for dozens of languages and powerful theme customization based on CSS-in-JS. The project aims to build a better user experience for web applications, solving common problems and pain points through its feature-rich components and utilities. Ant Design is widely used by developers and businesses to create modern, responsive, and accessible user interfaces for their web applications.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Component-based",
    "description": "Ant Design follows a component-based architecture, where the UI is composed of reusable, modular components. Each component encapsulates its own structure, styles, and behavior, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable. The components are designed to be highly customizable, allowing developers to easily adapt them to their specific needs. The project utilizes a design system approach, where the components are built upon a consistent set of design principles, patterns, and guidelines. This ensures a cohesive and visually appealing user experience across the application. The component-based architecture also enables better performance, as only the necessary components are rendered, and it facilitates easier testing and debugging. Additionally, the use of TypeScript provides static type checking, improving the overall code quality and developer productivity. The Ant Design team has carefully considered scalability and flexibility in the architectural decisions, making the library suitable for a wide range of web applications, from small-scale projects to enterprise-level systems."
