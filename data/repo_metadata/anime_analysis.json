  "overview": "Anime.js is a fast, multipurpose, and lightweight JavaScript animation library with a simple yet powerful API. It works with CSS properties, SVG, DOM attributes, and JavaScript objects, making it a versatile tool for creating dynamic and engaging user interfaces. The library is designed to be easy to use, with a focus on performance and flexibility. Anime.js provides a wide range of animation effects, including transforms, opacity, color, and more, allowing developers to create complex animations with minimal code. The library is particularly well-suited for web applications, where smooth and responsive animations are essential for providing a great user experience. Anime.js is 100% free and open-source, and is maintained by a community of developers who contribute to its ongoing development and improvement.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Modular",
    "description": "Anime.js follows a modular architecture, where the core functionality is divided into several smaller, reusable modules. This approach allows for better maintainability, testability, and flexibility in the library's development. The main modules include the animation engine, easing functions, timeline management, and utility functions. These modules interact with each other through well-defined interfaces, promoting loose coupling and making it easier to extend or modify the library's behavior. The modular design also enables selective importing of only the necessary modules, reducing the overall bundle size and improving performance. This architectural pattern was chosen to ensure Anime.js remains lightweight, extensible, and easy to integrate into a wide range of web development projects, from small-scale animations to complex, large-scale applications."
