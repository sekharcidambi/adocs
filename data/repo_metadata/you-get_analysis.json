  "overview": "You-Get is a tiny command-line utility to download media contents (videos, audios, images) from the web. It is designed for users who want to download online media for their own pleasure, without relying on proprietary software or closed-source technology. You-Get supports a wide range of popular websites such as YouTube, Youku, Niconico, and more. It allows users to download videos, stream them in a media player, download images by scraping web pages, and download arbitrary non-HTML binary files. The project aims to provide a simple, lightweight, and open-source alternative to proprietary media downloaders, catering to the needs of hackers, free software enthusiasts, and users who value control over their own computing experience.",

    "description": "The You-Get project follows a component-based architecture, where the core functionality is divided into modular components that can be easily extended or replaced. The main components include the command-line interface, the extractor modules for different websites, the downloader modules, and the media processing utilities. The command-line interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with the tool, while the extractor modules are responsible for parsing the web pages and extracting the relevant media information. The downloader modules handle the actual downloading of the media files, and the media processing utilities, such as FFmpeg, are used for tasks like merging video segments or converting file formats. This modular design allows for easy maintenance, testing, and expansion of the project, as new features or support for additional websites can be added by developing new components without affecting the existing ones. The component-based approach also promotes code reuse and makes the project more scalable and maintainable in the long run."
