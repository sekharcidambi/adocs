    "pattern": "Component-based",
    "description": "Bootstrap follows a component-based architecture, where the framework is composed of modular, reusable UI components that can be easily combined and customized to build complex web interfaces. The architecture is designed to promote code reuse, maintainability, and flexibility. The main components of the Bootstrap framework include a responsive grid system, typography styles, form controls, buttons, navigation elements, alerts, modals, carousels, and various JavaScript plugins. These components are implemented using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and are organized in a way that allows developers to easily integrate them into their projects. The component-based approach enables developers to quickly assemble web pages by combining pre-built UI elements, while also providing the ability to customize and extend the components to meet specific design requirements. This architectural pattern is well-suited for the Bootstrap project, as it aligns with the framework's goal of providing a comprehensive, yet flexible, set of tools for building responsive, mobile-first web applications."
