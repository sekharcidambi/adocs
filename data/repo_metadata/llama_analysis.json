  "overview": "Llama 2 is a large language model developed by Meta that is now accessible to individuals, creators, researchers, and businesses of all sizes. This release includes model weights and starting code for pre-trained and fine-tuned Llama language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters. The goal of Llama 2 is to unlock the power of large language models and enable experimentation, innovation, and responsible scaling of ideas. The project provides a minimal example to load and run inference on Llama 2 models, with more detailed examples and integrations available in the llama-cookbook repository. Llama 2 carries potential risks with use, so Meta has created a Responsible Use Guide and encourages reporting of any issues or risky content generated by the models.",

    "pattern": "Modular",
    "description": "The Llama 2 architecture follows a modular design, with separate repositories for the foundation models, safety components, toolchain, agentic system, and community-driven integrations. This modular approach allows for independent development and deployment of the different components, enabling flexibility and scalability. The foundation models are provided as pre-trained weights that can be loaded and used for inference, while the toolchain repository offers interfaces and implementations for model development tasks like fine-tuning, safety shielding, and synthetic data generation. The agentic system repository provides an end-to-end standalone Llama Stack system with an opinionated underlying interface for creating agentic applications. This modular architecture supports the evolving nature of the Llama project, allowing for incremental improvements and additions to the various components without disrupting the overall system. The separation of concerns and clear boundaries between the modules also facilitate easier maintenance, testing, and deployment of the Llama 2 ecosystem."
