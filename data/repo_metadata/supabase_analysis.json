  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Microservices",
    "description": "Supabase follows a microservices architecture, where each component of the platform is implemented as a separate service. This approach allows for greater scalability, flexibility, and maintainability of the system. The core components of the Supabase architecture include Postgres, Realtime, PostgREST, GoTrue, Storage, pg_graphql, postgres-meta, and Kong. These services communicate with each other through well-defined APIs, enabling the platform to be easily extended and integrated with other systems. The microservices architecture also allows for independent scaling and deployment of individual components, improving the overall resilience and availability of the platform. Additionally, the use of open-source technologies, such as Postgres and Elixir, ensures that the platform is enterprise-grade and can be self-hosted or deployed on various cloud platforms, providing flexibility and control for developers and organizations."

  "setup": {
    "install": "Supabase is a hosted platform, so there is no installation required. Users can sign up and start using Supabase at https://supabase.com/dashboard. Alternatively, Supabase can be self-hosted by following the instructions in the [Hosting Overview](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/hosting/overview) documentation.",
    "run": "To run Supabase, users can sign in to the Supabase Dashboard and create a new project. The dashboard provides a web-based interface for managing the Supabase services, including the database, authentication, storage, and functions.",
    "test": "Supabase provides client libraries for various programming languages, such as JavaScript, Flutter, Swift, Python, and more. To run tests, developers can use the appropriate client library for their project and follow the testing instructions in the [client library documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/client-libraries)."
