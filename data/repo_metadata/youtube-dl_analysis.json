  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Modular",
    "description": "The architecture of youtube-dl follows a modular design pattern, where the core functionality is separated into reusable components. The main components include the YoutubeDL class, which handles the overall download process, and the various extractor classes, each responsible for handling the extraction of video information from a specific website or service. This modular design allows for easy extensibility, as new extractors can be added without modifying the core codebase. The extractors are designed to be robust and tolerant to changes in the source websites, minimizing the impact of layout changes on the overall functionality of the tool. Additionally, the modular architecture allows for the easy integration of youtube-dl into other Python-based applications, as the YoutubeDL class can be used as a standalone component. The choice of a modular design pattern was driven by the need to accommodate the diverse and constantly evolving landscape of online video hosting services, while maintaining a codebase that is maintainable, extensible, and adaptable to future changes."
