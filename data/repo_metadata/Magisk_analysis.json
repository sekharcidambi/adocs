    "pattern": "Monolith",
    "description": "Magisk follows a monolithic architecture, where the entire suite of functionalities is bundled into a single application. This architectural pattern was chosen to provide a seamless and integrated user experience, allowing users to access all of Magisk's features from a centralized interface. The monolithic design simplifies the development and deployment process, as all components are tightly coupled and can be updated and maintained together. This approach also ensures that Magisk can effectively manage the complex interactions between its various modules, such as MagiskSU for providing root access, MagiskBoot for handling boot image modifications, and Zygisk for running code in application processes. The monolithic structure allows Magisk to leverage shared resources and maintain a consistent user experience across its different functionalities, making it a suitable choice for a comprehensive Android customization tool. However, as the project grows, the team may consider exploring more modular approaches, such as microservices, to improve scalability and maintainability in the long run."
