  "overview": "LocalSend is a free, open-source app that allows users to securely share files and messages with nearby devices over their local network without needing an internet connection. It uses a secure communication protocol that enables devices to communicate with each other using a REST API and HTTPS encryption. Unlike other messaging apps that rely on external servers, LocalSend does not require an internet connection or third-party servers, making it a fast and reliable solution for local communication. The app is cross-platform and supports a wide range of devices, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. It provides a user-friendly interface and a range of features, such as the ability to share files, send text messages, and manage received files. LocalSend is designed to be a versatile and secure tool for users who need to share data locally without relying on cloud-based services.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Microservices",
    "description": "LocalSend follows a microservices architecture, where the application is divided into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other using a REST API. This architectural pattern was chosen to ensure scalability, flexibility, and maintainability of the codebase. The main components of the system include the device discovery service, the file transfer service, the messaging service, and the user interface. Each of these services is responsible for a specific set of functionalities and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. The device discovery service is responsible for detecting nearby devices on the local network and establishing a secure connection between them. The file transfer service handles the secure transfer of files between devices, using HTTPS encryption to ensure data privacy. The messaging service enables users to send text messages to each other, and the user interface provides a unified view of the app's functionality. The microservices architecture allows the LocalSend team to easily add new features or modify existing ones without affecting the overall system's stability. It also enables the app to be easily ported to different platforms, as the platform-specific code can be encapsulated within the respective microservices. Additionally, the use of a REST API for communication between the microservices ensures that the system is scalable and can handle increasing numbers of users and devices without performance degradation."

  "setup": {
    "install": "To install LocalSend, you can download the app from the official website or from one of the supported app stores or package managers, depending on your platform. The installation process varies slightly across different platforms, but generally involves downloading the appropriate installer or package and following the on-screen instructions.",
    "run": "To run LocalSend, simply launch the app after installation. The app will automatically start scanning for nearby devices on your local network, and you can then use the app's features to share files, send messages, and manage received content.",
    "test": "LocalSend does not have a dedicated test suite, as it is a user-facing application. However, you can test the app's functionality by running it on different devices and attempting to share files, send messages, and perform other actions to ensure that the app is working as expected."
