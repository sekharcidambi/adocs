  "overview": "Mermaid is a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. The main purpose of Mermaid is to help documentation catch up with development. Mermaid addresses the problem of 'doc-rot' by enabling users to create easily modifiable diagrams that can be integrated into production scripts and other code. Mermaid allows even non-programmers to easily create detailed diagrams through the Mermaid Live Editor. Mermaid can be used with a variety of applications, including GitHub, and the project provides a list of integrations and community usages. The Beginner's Guide, Usage documentation, and Tutorials provide a more detailed introduction to Mermaid and its basic uses.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Component-based",
    "description": "Mermaid follows a component-based architecture, where the core functionality is divided into modular components that can be independently developed, tested, and deployed. The main components include the parser, renderer, layout engine, and diagram types (e.g., flowchart, sequence diagram, gantt chart). The parser component is responsible for parsing the Markdown-like text definitions and generating an abstract syntax tree (AST). The renderer component then takes the AST and generates the final SVG or HTML output. The layout engine is responsible for positioning the diagram elements based on the specific diagram type. This component-based approach allows for easy extensibility, as new diagram types can be added by implementing the necessary parsing and rendering logic. The architectural decisions to use a component-based pattern and Markdown-inspired syntax make Mermaid suitable for the project's goal of enabling easy creation and modification of diagrams, as well as integration into various applications and workflows."
