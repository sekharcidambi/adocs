  "overview": "This open-source project, 'Dive into Deep Learning' (D2L.ai), is an attempt to create a unified resource for learning deep learning. The project aims to teach readers concepts, background knowledge, and code, all in one place. It covers the critical thinking needed to analyze problems, the mathematical knowledge required to solve them, and the engineering skills necessary to implement solutions. The key goals are to provide free online access for everyone, offer sufficient technical depth to help readers become deep learning application scientists, include runnable code to demonstrate problem-solving in practice, allow for rapid iteration to keep up with the fast-paced deep learning field, and have a complementary forum for technical Q&A and experience sharing. The project has been recommended by leading academics and industry experts as an excellent deep learning textbook and resource for both students and practitioners.",

    "pattern": "Monolith",
    "description": "The 'd2l-zh' repository follows a monolithic architecture, where all the content, including text, equations, figures, and code, is contained within a single codebase. This approach allows for tight integration between the different components, making it easier to maintain consistency and coherence throughout the learning material. The monolithic structure also simplifies the development and deployment processes, as there is a single codebase to manage. This architectural decision is well-suited for the project's goal of providing a comprehensive and unified learning resource for deep learning, where the seamless integration of concepts, theory, and practical implementation is crucial for the target audience of students and practitioners. The monolithic design enables the project maintainers to quickly iterate on the content and make updates across the entire resource, ensuring that the material stays up-to-date with the rapidly evolving field of deep learning."
