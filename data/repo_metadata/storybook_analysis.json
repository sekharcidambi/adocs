  "overview": "Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. It is a popular open-source tool used by thousands of teams for UI development, testing, and documentation. Storybook provides a development environment where UI components can be built, tested, and documented independently of the application they will be used in. This allows developers to work on UI components in a more efficient and organized manner, without the need to set up the entire application. Storybook supports a wide range of JavaScript frameworks, including React, Angular, Vue, and more, making it a versatile tool for frontend development teams. It comes with a rich set of addons that extend its functionality, enabling features like accessibility testing, documentation generation, and interactive component exploration.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Component-based",
    "description": "Storybook follows a component-based architecture, where the entire application is built up from reusable UI components. This architectural pattern is well-suited for Storybook's purpose of providing a development environment for building and testing UI components in isolation. The core of Storybook is the Storybook Server, which manages the rendering and interaction of UI components. The server communicates with the Storybook Client, which is responsible for displaying the UI components and handling user interactions. The Storybook Client can be integrated into various frontend frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue, through the use of framework-specific renderers. This modular and extensible architecture allows Storybook to support a wide range of frameworks and provide a consistent development experience across different projects and teams. The component-based approach also aligns well with modern frontend development practices, where the focus is on building reusable, testable, and maintainable UI components."
