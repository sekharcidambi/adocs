  "overview": "Playwright is a framework for Web Testing and Automation. It allows testing Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast. It provides resilient testing with auto-wait, web-first assertions, and tracing capabilities to eliminate flaky tests. Playwright supports testing scenarios that span multiple tabs, multiple origins and multiple users, with full isolation and fast execution. It also offers powerful tooling like Codegen for recording and generating tests, Playwright Inspector for inspecting pages and generating selectors, and Trace Viewer for investigating test failures. Playwright is available for multiple programming languages including TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, .NET, and Java, making it a versatile tool for web automation and testing across different platforms and browsers.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Microservices",
    "description": "Playwright's architecture is designed around the modern browser architecture, where web content belonging to different origins runs in different processes. This allows Playwright to run tests out-of-process, free from the typical in-process test runner limitations. The core Playwright library is structured as a set of microservices, each responsible for a specific aspect of the web automation functionality, such as browser management, network interception, input handling, and more. This modular design promotes scalability, maintainability, and flexibility, as new features and capabilities can be added without affecting the core functionality. The microservices communicate with each other using a well-defined API, ensuring a high degree of isolation and testability. This architectural pattern was chosen to align with the modern browser architecture and provide a robust, extensible, and performant web automation solution."
