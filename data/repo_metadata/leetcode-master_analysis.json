    "description": "The 'leetcode-master' repository follows a monolithic architecture, as it is a single, self-contained project that encompasses all the solutions and explanations for the LeetCode problems. This architectural pattern is well-suited for this type of project, as the focus is on providing a comprehensive collection of coding solutions and educational content, rather than a complex, distributed system. The monolithic structure allows for easier organization, maintenance, and updates to the repository, as all the related files and resources are contained within a single codebase. This approach simplifies the development, testing, and deployment processes, making it easier for contributors to collaborate and for users to navigate and utilize the provided content. The monolithic architecture also ensures that the solutions and explanations are tightly integrated, providing a cohesive learning experience for the users."
