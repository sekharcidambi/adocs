  "overview": "Nodemon is an open-source command-line tool that automatically restarts a Node.js application when file changes in the directory are detected. It is designed to enhance the development workflow by eliminating the need to manually restart the server after making changes to the codebase. Nodemon monitors the file system, and when it detects changes, it automatically restarts the Node.js process, allowing developers to instantly see the effects of their modifications. This tool is particularly useful for building and testing Node.js applications, as it streamlines the development process and improves productivity by reducing the time and effort required to manually restart the server. Nodemon supports a wide range of file types, including JavaScript, CoffeeScript, and TypeScript, and can be configured to watch specific directories and ignore certain files or patterns.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Event-driven",
    "description": "The architecture of Nodemon follows an event-driven design pattern. The core of Nodemon is a command-line interface (CLI) that parses the user's input and configures the application's behavior. The CLI interacts with a set of rules that determine which files to watch and how to handle changes. When a file change is detected, Nodemon triggers an event that starts the process of restarting the Node.js application. This event-driven approach allows Nodemon to efficiently monitor the file system and respond to changes in real-time, without the need for polling or continuous checking. The modular design of Nodemon, with its separate components for parsing, configuring, and watching, makes it easy to extend and maintain the application. This architectural pattern ensures that Nodemon is scalable, flexible, and responsive to the needs of developers working on Node.js projects."
