  "overview": "Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system that handles a wide range of tasks, including configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. It is designed to be extremely easy to set up and use, with a minimal learning curve. Ansible is agentless, leveraging the existing SSH daemon on remote machines, and allows infrastructure to be described in a language that is both machine and human-friendly. It focuses on security and easy auditability, and enables the management of new remote machines instantly without any bootstrapping. Ansible supports module development in any dynamic language, not just Python, and can be used as a non-root user, making it a highly flexible and accessible automation tool.",

    "pattern": "Agentless, Modular",
    "description": "Ansible's architecture is designed around the principle of being agentless, which means it does not require the installation of any custom software on the remote machines it manages. Instead, Ansible leverages the existing SSH daemon on the target systems, allowing it to execute commands and transfer files without the need for additional agents or open ports. This approach simplifies the setup process and reduces the attack surface, as there are no custom agents to maintain or secure.The modular nature of Ansible's architecture is another key feature. Ansible's functionality is divided into various modules, each of which is responsible for a specific task or operation, such as managing packages, files, services, or cloud resources. These modules can be written in any dynamic language, not just Python, making it easy for the community to extend Ansible's capabilities. The modular design also allows for better scalability, as new modules can be added without affecting the core Ansible engine.Ansible's architecture also includes a control node, where the Ansible engine runs, and the managed nodes, which are the remote systems that Ansible interacts with. The control node is responsible for orchestrating the execution of tasks on the managed nodes, and it can manage multiple nodes in parallel, improving efficiency and reducing the time required for complex operations.The choice of an agentless, modular architecture aligns well with Ansible's design principles, which emphasize simplicity, security, and ease of use. This architecture allows Ansible to be quickly deployed and integrated into existing IT environments, while also providing the flexibility to extend its functionality as needed."

  "setup": {
    "install": "You can install a released version of Ansible with `pip` or a package manager. See the [installation guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) for details on installing Ansible on a variety of platforms.",
    "run": "Ansible is run from the control node, where the Ansible engine is installed. There is no specific command to 'run' Ansible, as it is used to execute various tasks and playbooks on the managed nodes.",
    "test": "Ansible provides a number of ways to test your configuration and playbooks, including the `ansible-playbook` command with the `--syntax-check` and `--list-tasks` options, as well as the `ansible-lint` tool for checking best practices. The specific test commands will depend on the structure and contents of your Ansible project."
