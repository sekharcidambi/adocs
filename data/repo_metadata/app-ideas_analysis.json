  "overview": "This is a collection of over 100 app ideas across three tiers of difficulty, ranging from beginner to advanced. The projects are designed to help developers improve their coding skills, experiment with new technologies, and build impressive portfolio projects. Each project includes a clear objective, user stories, bonus features, and resources to help developers complete the project from scratch. The app ideas cover a wide range of domains, including productivity, utilities, games, data visualization, and more. The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive resource for developers to practice and enhance their programming abilities, while also building a diverse portfolio of completed projects.",

    "pattern": "Monolith",
    "description": "This project is structured as a monolithic repository, containing all the app idea documentation and resources in a single codebase. This architectural pattern was chosen for its simplicity and ease of management, as the project is primarily a curated collection of ideas and guidelines rather than a complex, interconnected application. The monolithic structure allows for centralized organization, version control, and collaboration on the project. While a more modular, microservices-based approach could be considered for a larger, more feature-rich application, the straightforward nature of this project lends itself well to the monolithic pattern. This allows the maintainers to focus on curating and improving the app idea content, rather than managing a distributed, multi-service architecture."
