  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Serverless, API-driven",
    "description": "The github-readme-stats project follows a serverless, API-driven architecture. The core functionality is implemented as a serverless function that runs on the Vercel platform. This architectural pattern was chosen to provide a scalable, cost-effective, and easy-to-deploy solution for generating and serving the GitHub statistics cards. The serverless function handles the data fetching from the GitHub API, the card generation, and the response delivery to the client. This approach allows the project to scale automatically based on demand, without the need to manage and maintain a dedicated server infrastructure. The API-driven design also enables easy integration and customization, as users can simply call the provided API endpoints to retrieve the desired GitHub statistics cards. The serverless architecture and API-driven approach make github-readme-stats a highly flexible and maintainable project, well-suited for its purpose of providing dynamic GitHub profile statistics."
