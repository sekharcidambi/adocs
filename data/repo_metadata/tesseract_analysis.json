  "overview": "Tesseract is an open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine that can be used to extract text from images and PDF documents. It is a powerful tool for developers who need to automate text extraction and document processing tasks. Tesseract supports over 100 languages out of the box and can be trained to recognize additional languages or specialized vocabularies. The project includes both a command-line interface and a C/C++ API that allows developers to integrate Tesseract into their own applications. Tesseract was originally developed by Hewlett-Packard and has been maintained by Google and a community of contributors since 2006. The current stable version, Tesseract 5, was released in 2021 and includes a new neural network-based OCR engine in addition to the legacy character pattern-based engine. Tesseract is widely used in a variety of applications, including document digitization, text extraction from images, and automated data entry.",

    "description": "Tesseract is designed using a component-based architecture, with the core OCR engine implemented as a library (libtesseract) that can be integrated into other applications. The library provides a set of APIs for performing OCR tasks, including image preprocessing, text extraction, and language model management. The project also includes a command-line interface (tesseract) that wraps the library and provides a simple way to perform OCR on images and PDF documents. The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, with the ability to add support for new image formats, languages, and output formats through the use of plugins and external data files. The core OCR engine is implemented using a combination of traditional character pattern recognition and a newer neural network-based approach, allowing it to handle a wide range of document types and languages. The component-based design of Tesseract makes it easy to integrate into larger systems and applications, and the availability of both a C/C++ API and language bindings for other programming languages allows developers to use Tesseract in a variety of contexts. The architecture also supports parallel processing and distributed computing, enabling Tesseract to scale to handle large volumes of documents or high-resolution images."
