  "overview": "webpack is a popular open-source JavaScript module bundler used to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser. It takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. It is designed to be highly configurable, allowing developers to customize the bundling process to fit their specific needs. webpack's main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, but it can also be used to transform, package, or manage just about any resource or asset. It provides a powerful set of features and configuration options that allow developers to optimize their front-end assets, including code splitting, asset management, and development tooling. By abstracting away many of the complexities of front-end development, webpack helps developers build modern, modular web applications more efficiently.",

    "description": "webpack follows a modular architecture, where the core functionality is divided into a set of interconnected modules. The main components of the webpack architecture include the Compiler, Compilation, Resolver, and Plugins. The Compiler is responsible for the overall bundling process, managing the dependency graph, and generating the final output. The Compilation handles the processing of individual modules, applying transformations, and managing the asset dependencies. The Resolver is responsible for resolving module dependencies, locating the appropriate files, and handling various module resolution strategies. Plugins provide a flexible extension point, allowing developers to customize the bundling process, add new functionality, and integrate with other tools. This modular design promotes extensibility, maintainability, and the ability to tailor webpack to specific project requirements. The architecture also supports a plugin-based system, enabling developers to easily integrate third-party functionality and create their own custom plugins. This modular approach allows webpack to be highly configurable and adaptable, making it a powerful tool for modern front-end development."
