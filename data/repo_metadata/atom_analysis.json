    "description": "Atom is built using the Electron framework, which allows the application to be developed using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while still providing access to native operating system features. The Electron architecture follows a main-renderer process model, where the main process manages the application lifecycle and native system interactions, while the renderer processes handle the user interface and application logic. This separation of concerns allows Atom to leverage the performance and capabilities of the underlying operating system, while still providing a familiar web-based development experience. The Electron architecture also enables cross-platform compatibility, allowing Atom to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. The use of Electron was a strategic decision to make Atom highly customizable and extensible, as developers can create packages and themes using the same web technologies they use for the core application."
