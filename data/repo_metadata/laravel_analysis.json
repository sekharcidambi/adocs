  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Model-View-Controller (MVC)",
    "description": "Laravel follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which is a common design pattern used in web application development. In the MVC pattern, the application logic is separated into three interconnected components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application, the View handles the presentation and user interface, and the Controller acts as an intermediary, processing user input and updating the Model and View accordingly. This separation of concerns promotes code organization, maintainability, and testability. Laravel's implementation of the MVC pattern is further enhanced by its Dependency Injection (DI) container, which manages the creation and injection of dependencies between components, and its routing system, which maps URL requests to the appropriate Controller actions. This architectural approach allows for scalable and modular web application development, making it suitable for a wide range of projects, from small-scale websites to large-scale enterprise applications."
