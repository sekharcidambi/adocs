  "overview": "Gatsby is a free and open-source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. It combines the control and scalability of dynamically rendered sites with the speed of static-site generation, creating a whole new web of possibilities. Gatsby pulls in data from any data source, whether it's Markdown files, a headless CMS like Contentful or WordPress, or a REST or GraphQL API. Developers can then develop using Gatsby's uniform GraphQL interface. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps, so developers can create high-quality, dynamic web apps, from blogs to e-commerce sites to user dashboards. Gatsby automates code splitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading, prefetching resources, and more to ensure sites are fast by default, with no manual tuning required. Gatsby sites can be hosted on a CDN for a fraction of the cost of a server-rendered site, and many can be hosted entirely free on services like Netlify.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Component-based",
    "description": "Gatsby uses a component-based architecture, where the entire application is built using reusable React components. These components encapsulate the UI, logic, and data requirements for different parts of the application. Gatsby's data layer, powered by GraphQL, provides a uniform interface for fetching data from various sources and making it available to the components. The build process in Gatsby generates static HTML files for each page, which are then optimized and deployed to a CDN for fast delivery. This component-based, static-site generation approach allows for high performance, scalability, and developer productivity, as changes can be made to individual components without affecting the entire application. The architectural decisions behind Gatsby, such as the use of React, GraphQL, and static-site generation, make it well-suited for building modern, high-performance websites and web applications."
