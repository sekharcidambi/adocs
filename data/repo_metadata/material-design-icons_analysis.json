  "business_domain": "Developer Tools",
  "overview": "This project provides two official icon sets from Google - Material Symbols and Material Icons. Material Symbols is the current set, introduced in 2022, and is built on variable font technology. It offers a range of design axes like optical size, weight, grade, and fill that can be adjusted in CSS or design apps. Material Icons is the classic set, but is no longer updated. Both icon sets are designed under the Material Design guidelines and can be used to create visually consistent and accessible user interfaces. The icons are available in various styles like outlined, rounded, sharp, and two-tone. While Google Fonts hosts the official web fonts, this repository provides the underlying font files and SVGs for developers to use in their projects. The project also includes documentation on how to use the icons, guidelines for submitting new icon requests, and information on third-party npm packages that provide additional functionality.",

    "description": "The material-design-icons project follows a component-based architecture, where each icon is treated as an individual component. The icons are organized into directories based on their style (e.g., outlined, rounded, sharp) and format (e.g., font, SVG). This modular structure allows developers to easily integrate the specific icons they need into their projects, without having to include the entire icon set. The use of variable fonts for the Material Symbols set also enables dynamic customization of icon appearance through CSS properties, making the icons highly flexible and adaptable to different design requirements. The project's architecture prioritizes modularity, reusability, and ease of integration, which aligns well with the needs of developers who require access to a comprehensive set of high-quality, material-designed icons for their applications."

  "setup": {
    "install": "The icons can be installed by linking to the Google Fonts CDN or by including the pre-generated font files from the `font` and `variablefont` directories in the project.",
    "run": "There is no specific command to run the application, as this is a library of icons. Developers can use the icons in their projects by referencing the appropriate CSS classes or font families.",
    "test": "There are no automated tests provided for this project. Developers can visually inspect the icons to ensure they are rendering correctly in their applications."
