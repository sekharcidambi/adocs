  "overview": "Alist is an open-source file list program that supports multiple cloud storage providers, including local storage, Aliyundrive, OneDrive, GoogleDrive, FTP/SFTP, S3, and many others. It provides a user-friendly web interface for browsing, previewing, and managing files across these different storage platforms. Alist is designed to be easy to deploy and use out-of-the-box, with features like file preview, image gallery, video/audio playback, office document preview, and support for password-protected routes. The project aims to simplify file management and sharing for developers, businesses, and end-users by unifying access to their files across various cloud storage services. Alist is powered by the Gin web framework and Solidjs, and is licensed under the AGPL-3.0 open-source license.",

    "description": "Alist follows a microservices architectural pattern, with the backend and frontend components decoupled and communicating via a well-defined API. The backend is written in Go and handles storage integrations, file management, authentication, and other core functionality. The frontend is built using Solidjs, a modern JavaScript framework, and provides the user interface for interacting with the file system. This separation of concerns allows the backend and frontend to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, improving overall system flexibility, maintainability, and scalability. The microservices architecture also enables Alist to support a wide range of storage providers by encapsulating the integration logic within the backend services. This design decision makes Alist more extensible and adaptable to the evolving needs of users and the changing cloud storage landscape. Additionally, the use of well-defined APIs between the backend and frontend promotes modularity, allowing for potential future expansion or replacement of individual components without disrupting the entire system."
