    "description": "Tabby is a cross-platform terminal emulator application built using modern web technologies, including Electron, React, and TypeScript. The application follows a component-based architecture, where the user interface is divided into reusable components that handle specific functionalities, such as tabs, panes, and terminal sessions. This modular design allows for easy extensibility and customization, as new features can be added or existing ones modified without affecting the core application. The use of Electron enables Tabby to run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, while providing a native-like user experience. The application's architecture is designed to be scalable, with the ability to handle multiple concurrent terminal sessions and provide a responsive and performant interface, even on lower-end hardware. This cross-platform approach ensures that Tabby can be used by a wide range of developers and power users, regardless of their operating system preference."
