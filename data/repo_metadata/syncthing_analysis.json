  "overview": "Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program that allows users to synchronize files between two or more computers. It is designed to be safe from data loss, secure against attackers, easy to use, automatic, and universally available. Syncthing empowers individual users with safe, secure, and easy-to-use file synchronization, protecting their data from corruption, eavesdropping, and unauthorized modification. It runs on a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it accessible to a wide range of users. Syncthing uses a decentralized, peer-to-peer architecture to ensure that users maintain control over their data and that there is no single point of failure or centralized authority.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Peer-to-Peer",
    "description": "Syncthing uses a peer-to-peer architecture, where each device running the Syncthing software acts as both a client and a server. Devices discover each other using a discovery server, but all data synchronization happens directly between the peers, without passing through any central server. This decentralized approach ensures that users maintain control over their data and that there is no single point of failure. The peer-to-peer design also allows Syncthing to scale well, as the network can accommodate more devices without a central bottleneck. Syncthing uses the Block Exchange Protocol (BEP) to efficiently transfer file changes between peers, minimizing the amount of data that needs to be transferred. The architecture is designed to be secure, with end-to-end encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect against eavesdropping and unauthorized access. This peer-to-peer, decentralized approach aligns well with Syncthing's goals of being safe, secure, and empowering for individual users."
