    "description": "The 'Python-100-Days' repository follows a monolithic architectural pattern, as it is a self-contained collection of educational materials and resources focused on learning the Python programming language. The project does not have a complex system architecture, as it is primarily a learning resource and not a software application. The content is organized in a structured manner, with each day's lesson or topic presented as a separate section or module within the repository. This monolithic structure allows for easy navigation and access to the various learning materials, making it straightforward for users to follow the progression of the course and focus on specific areas of interest. The simplicity of the monolithic approach is well-suited for the educational nature of this project, as it provides a cohesive and organized learning experience for the users. The lack of a complex system architecture also ensures that the focus remains on the content and learning objectives, rather than on the underlying technical infrastructure."
