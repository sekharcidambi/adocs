  "overview": "Stirling-PDF is a robust, locally hosted web-based PDF manipulation tool built using Docker. It enables users to perform a wide range of operations on PDF files, including splitting, merging, converting, reorganizing, adding images, rotating, compressing, and more. This comprehensive web application addresses all PDF-related requirements, providing a user-friendly interface for both individual and enterprise users. All files and PDFs are handled securely, either residing exclusively on the client side or temporarily in server memory during task execution, ensuring data privacy. Stirling-PDF offers over 50 PDF-related features, parallel file processing, dark mode support, custom download options, automated pipelines, and an API for integration with external scripts. It also includes optional authentication, database backup/import, and enterprise-level features like single sign-on (SSO) support.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Microservices",
    "description": "Stirling-PDF follows a microservices architecture, where the application is divided into several independent, loosely coupled services that communicate with each other over a network. This architectural pattern was chosen to ensure scalability, flexibility, and maintainability of the system. The core services include the web server, PDF processing engine, authentication service, and database management. These services are containerized using Docker, allowing for easy deployment, scaling, and resource isolation. The web server handles user interactions and orchestrates the various PDF operations, delegating the actual processing tasks to the PDF engine service. The authentication service manages user accounts and permissions, while the database service stores user data and configuration settings. This modular design enables the team to independently develop, test, and deploy individual components, improving overall development velocity and resilience. The microservices communicate using a message queue system, ensuring asynchronous and fault-tolerant communication between the components. Additionally, the system is designed with security in mind, with each service running in its own isolated container and communicating over secure channels. This architectural pattern allows Stirling-PDF to scale efficiently, handle high-volume PDF processing, and provide a reliable and secure user experience."
