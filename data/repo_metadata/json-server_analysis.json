  "overview": "json-server is an open-source Node.js package that provides a full fake REST API with zero coding in just a few minutes. It takes a JSON file or JavaScript object as input and generates a customizable API with all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This allows developers to quickly set up a mock backend for their front-end applications during development, without the need to build a real backend server. The project aims to simplify the development process by enabling developers to focus on the front-end while having a realistic API to interact with. json-server supports various query parameters for filtering, sorting, paginating, and embedding data, making it a versatile tool for rapid prototyping and testing of web applications.",

  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Monolith",
    "description": "The json-server project follows a monolithic architectural pattern. It is a single, self-contained application that provides the entire functionality of the mock REST API. The application is built using Node.js and Express.js, which handle the routing, request processing, and response generation. The data for the API is stored in a JSON file or JavaScript object, which is loaded and managed by the application. The monolithic design allows for a simple and straightforward implementation, as all the components (routing, data handling, and server functionality) are integrated within a single codebase. This approach is suitable for the project's purpose of quickly setting up a mock backend, as it provides a simple and easy-to-use solution without the complexity of a distributed or microservices-based architecture. The monolithic design also simplifies the deployment and maintenance of the project, as it can be easily packaged and distributed as a single Node.js application."
