  "overview": "The TensorFlow Model Garden is a repository that provides a collection of state-of-the-art (SOTA) machine learning models and modeling solutions for TensorFlow users. It aims to demonstrate best practices for modeling so that TensorFlow users can take full advantage of TensorFlow for their research and product development. The repository includes officially maintained and supported models using the latest TensorFlow 2 APIs, as well as research models implemented by researchers. It also provides a flexible and lightweight training experiment framework that allows users to quickly configure and run training experiments using the official models and standard datasets. Additionally, the Model Garden contains specialized machine learning operations for vision and natural language processing tasks, and a training loop management library called Orbit that simplifies writing custom training loops in TensorFlow 2.x.",

    "description": "The TensorFlow Model Garden follows a component-based architectural pattern. The repository is organized into several directories, each containing a distinct set of models or tools. The 'official' directory contains officially maintained and supported models that use the latest TensorFlow 2 APIs, while the 'research' directory contains models implemented by researchers. The 'community' directory provides a curated list of GitHub repositories with TensorFlow 2 machine learning models and implementations. The 'orbit' directory contains the Orbit library, which is a flexible and lightweight tool for writing custom training loops in TensorFlow 2.x. This component-based structure allows for modular development, easy maintenance, and the ability to add new models or tools without affecting the existing ones. The architecture also supports different device types (CPU, GPU, TPU) and seamlessly integrates with TensorFlow's distributed training capabilities through the 'tf.distribute' module. This modular and extensible design makes the TensorFlow Model Garden a versatile platform for machine learning research and development."
