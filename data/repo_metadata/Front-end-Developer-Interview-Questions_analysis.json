    "description": "The 'Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions' repository follows a monolithic architectural pattern. As a collection of interview questions and answers, the project is self-contained and does not require any complex interactions or integrations with external systems. The repository is organized in a simple, straightforward manner, with the main content being the markdown files containing the interview questions and their corresponding answers. This monolithic approach is well-suited for the project's purpose, as it allows for easy maintenance, updates, and distribution of the interview questions. The simplicity of the monolithic architecture ensures that the repository is easy to navigate, contribute to, and use by front-end developers seeking to prepare for interviews. The lack of complex dependencies or infrastructure requirements makes the project accessible and easy to set up, which aligns with its goal of being a readily available resource for the front-end development community."
