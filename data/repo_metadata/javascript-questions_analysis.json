    "description": "The javascript-questions repository follows a monolithic architectural pattern, as it is a single, self-contained project that does not have any external dependencies or microservices. The project is organized as a collection of Markdown files, each containing a specific JavaScript interview question and its corresponding explanation. This simple, file-based structure allows for easy maintenance, updates, and contributions from the community. The monolithic approach is well-suited for this type of educational and reference-based project, as it provides a straightforward and cohesive way to present the JavaScript concepts and questions. The lack of complex dependencies or distributed components makes the project easy to set up, run, and test, ensuring a seamless experience for developers who want to use the repository to enhance their JavaScript skills. The monolithic architecture also simplifies the overall project management and ensures a consistent user experience across the various JavaScript topics covered in the repository."
