  "overview": "This repository contains JavaScript-based examples of many popular algorithms and data structures. It is a comprehensive collection of common algorithmic and data structure implementations that can be used for learning, research, and reference purposes. The project aims to help developers deepen their understanding of fundamental computer science concepts through interactive examples and detailed explanations. Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README file with related explanations, links for further reading, and in some cases, YouTube video references. The repository covers a wide range of topics, including math, sets, strings, searches, sorting, linked lists, trees, graphs, cryptography, machine learning, image processing, and more. It is an open-source project that welcomes contributions from the community to expand the collection and improve the existing implementations.",

    "pattern": "Modular",
    "description": "The project follows a modular architecture, where each algorithm and data structure is implemented in a separate directory or module. This modular approach allows for easy organization, maintenance, and extensibility of the codebase. The project is structured around the concept of algorithms and data structures, with each implementation contained within its own directory. Within each directory, there is a README file that provides detailed explanations, time and space complexity analysis, and references for the specific algorithm or data structure. This modular design makes it easy for developers to navigate the repository, understand the individual components, and contribute new implementations or improvements without affecting the overall structure of the project. The modular architecture also facilitates testing and code reuse, as each module can be tested and integrated independently. This design decision aligns with the project's goal of being a comprehensive reference for common computer science concepts, making it easy for developers to explore, learn, and apply the various algorithms and data structures."
