  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Component-based",
    "description": "The developer-roadmap project follows a component-based architecture, which allows for modular and scalable development. The project is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the roadmaps and content being stored in separate data files. This architecture enables easy maintenance and updates, as changes to individual components or data files can be made without affecting the overall structure of the application. The project also utilizes a static site generator, which generates the final HTML pages from the component-based structure, ensuring fast load times and efficient delivery of the content. The component-based approach also allows for easy integration of new roadmaps or features, as new components can be added without disrupting the existing functionality. This architectural pattern was chosen to support the project's goal of providing a scalable and maintainable platform for delivering educational content to developers."
