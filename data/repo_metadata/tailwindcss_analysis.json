  "overview": "Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes that can be used to style HTML elements, allowing developers to create complex and responsive designs without writing custom CSS. The framework is highly customizable, allowing developers to create their own color schemes, typography, and other design elements. Tailwind CSS is particularly useful for building web applications, as it enables developers to create consistent and visually appealing user interfaces with minimal effort. The framework is widely used in the web development community and has a large and active community of contributors and users.",

    "pattern": "Utility-first CSS",
    "description": "Tailwind CSS follows a utility-first approach to CSS, which means that it provides a set of low-level utility classes that can be combined to create complex styles. This approach is in contrast to the traditional approach of writing custom CSS rules for each component or element. The utility-first approach allows developers to quickly prototype and iterate on designs without having to write a lot of custom CSS. The framework is designed to be highly modular and customizable, with the ability to add or remove utility classes as needed. The architecture also includes a build process that generates the final CSS output based on the utility classes used in the HTML. This approach allows for efficient file size and performance, as only the necessary styles are included in the final output."
