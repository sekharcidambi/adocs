It aims to be high-level and easy to use.\n\n### Key features:\n* **Fast**: High-level interface means less code and faster development\n* **Simple**: Build MCP servers with minimal boilerplate\n* **Complete***: MCP Go aims to provide a full implementation of the core MCP specification\n\n(\\*emphasis on *aims*)\n\nüö® üöß üèóÔ∏è *MCP Go is under active development, as is the MCP specification itself. Core features are working but some advanced capabilities are still in progress.* \n\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n- [What is MCP?](#what-is-mcp)\n- [Core Concepts](#core-concepts)\n  - [Server](#server)\n  - [Resources](#resources)\n  - [Tools](#tools)\n  - [Prompts](#prompts)\n- [Examples](#examples)\n- [Extras](#extras)\n  - [Transports](#transports)\n  - [Session Management](#session-management)\n    - [Basic Session Handling](#basic-session-handling)\n    - [Per-Session Tools](#per-session-tools)\n    - [Tool Filtering](#tool-filtering)\n    - [Working with Context](#working-with-context)\n  - [Request Hooks](#request-hooks)\n  - [Tool Handler Middleware](#tool-handler-middleware)\n  - [Regenerating Server Code](#regenerating-server-code)\n\n## Installation",
