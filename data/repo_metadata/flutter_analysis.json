  "overview": "Flutter is Google's open-source UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source. Flutter enables developers to create fast, high-performance apps with a productive, extensible, and open development model. It provides a layered architecture that gives developers full control over every pixel on the screen, powerful compositing capabilities, and a rich set of widgets that deliver pixel-perfect experiences on multiple platforms. Flutter is powered by the Dart programming language and its fast, hardware-accelerated 2D graphics engine, allowing for glitch-free, jank-free graphics at native speeds. The project emphasizes developer productivity with features like stateful hot reload, which allows developers to make changes to their code and see the results instantly without restarting their app or losing its state.",

    "description": "Flutter follows a layered architecture, which provides developers with full control over every pixel on the screen. The architecture consists of several key layers: the Dart platform, the Flutter engine, and the Flutter framework. The Dart platform powers Flutter's code, enabling compilation to 32-bit and 64-bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android, as well as JavaScript and WebAssembly for the web, and Intel x64 and ARM for desktop devices. The Flutter engine is responsible for the low-level rendering and platform integration, using hardware-accelerated 2D graphics libraries like Skia and Impeller to provide glitch-free, jank-free graphics at native speeds. The Flutter framework sits on top of the engine, providing a rich set of widgets and tools that deliver pixel-perfect experiences on multiple platforms, including iOS (Cupertino) and Android (Material). This layered architecture allows Flutter to be highly extensible and customizable, enabling developers to create unique user experiences without being limited by the underlying framework."
