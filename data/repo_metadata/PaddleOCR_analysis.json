  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Modular, Microservices",
    "description": "PaddleOCR follows a modular, microservices-based architecture that allows for flexible, scalable, and extensible document AI solutions. The system is composed of several independent pipelines, each focused on a specific task like text recognition, document parsing, or information extraction. These pipelines can be used individually or combined to create end-to-end document processing workflows. The modular design allows new capabilities to be easily added, and the microservices approach enables high-performance, fault-tolerant deployment on heterogeneous hardware like CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs. The architectural decisions prioritize scalability, maintainability, and the ability to rapidly bring AI-powered document applications to production."
