Overview: RAG-based Documentation Generation
We will implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This approach is superior to rule-based systems or simple classification because it leverages the nuanced understanding of an LLM while grounding its output in real-world, high-quality examples from our own ecosystem.

The data will flow through these four main stages:

Data Pre-processing & Embedding: We'll create a unified dataset from our 200+ repos and convert key metadata fields into numerical representations (vector embeddings) that capture their semantic meaning.

Similarity Search (Retrieval): For a new repo, we'll use its embedding to find the most similar repos from our knowledge base using vector similarity search.

Prompt Engineering (Augmentation): We'll construct a detailed prompt for an LLM, providing it with the new repo's metadata and the documentation structures of the similar repos we found.

LLM Call (Generation): We'll send the prompt to a powerful LLM (like Gemini or GPT-4) and instruct it to generate the final, structured JSON output.

Core Components
Component 1: Knowledge Base Builder
Function: A script that runs once (or whenever our repos are updated) to prepare our data.

Process:

Parse the deepwiki_docs.json file to create a dictionary mapping a GitHub URL to its documentation structure.

Iterate through all {repo_name}_analysis.json files.

For each repo, combine key textual metadata (overview, business_domain, architecture.description, and a string representation of the tech_stack) into a single text block.

Use a sentence-transformer model (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to convert this text block into a vector embedding.

Store the original metadata, the documentation structure, and the generated embedding together. The final output will be a list of objects or a Pandas DataFrame saved to a file (e.g., knowledge_base.pkl).

Component 2: Documentation Generator
This will be the main application logic, likely encapsulated in a Python class.

Function: Takes a new repo's metadata and generates its documentation structure.

Process:

Load: Load the pre-processed knowledge_base.pkl file.

Embed Input: Take the new repo's metadata, create the same combined text block as in the builder, and generate its vector embedding using the same sentence-transformer model.

Retrieve: Calculate the cosine similarity between the new repo's embedding and all embeddings in the knowledge base. Identify the top 3 most similar repositories.

Augment & Generate:

Construct a carefully formatted prompt for an LLM.

The prompt will include:

The full metadata JSON of the new repository.

The full documentation structure JSON for each of the top 3 similar repositories as examples.

A clear instruction to act as a principal engineer and generate a new documentation structure based on the provided context, ensuring the output is valid JSON.

Make an API call to a generative AI model.

Validate & Return: Parse the LLM's response, validate that it is well-formed JSON, and return the result.
